# Checklist

## NOTES
I'm struggling with the navigation categories. I got them to work to some extent, but I have a desire to make them
this infinitely deep list that could be made. I don't know if it's worth it, but I think that checking out shutterfly will help me know.
If I don't do it now, it's not the end of the world it would just kind of suck for a second while migrating to the new system. So
perhaps I should ask nikki...

Either way, I really want to have the categories kind of up top, with a selection of products below. If you want to continue to wittle it down
you click on a category, otherwise you browse the products below. I also still need to figure out a search type thing, but I think that that comes after the
cart and checkout are done.

## Other things to Do 

### Important Detail Things

### Auth
- [ ] Github sign up callback to account management

## Things to do after everything is hosted
- [ ] When an auth group gets deleted, what happens to the routes and users that are a part of that auth group?

## Ideas
- [ ] Make certain tags hideable from product pages (for example for tags that might only have to do with stores or something)
- [ ] Infinite-depth navigation categories, every navigation category has a reference to it's parent
